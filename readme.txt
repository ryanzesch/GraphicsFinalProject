Project 4

To build, make a build directory, run 'cmake ..' in that directory, make, and enjoy.
After building, run with ./P4

Controls:
    W/S    - Dolly camera
    A/D    - Strafe camera
    Mouse  - Change view direction - should be continuous, mouse invisible + locked at center of window
    LShift - Sprint while moving (Also changes FOV)
    Q/E    - Select a card to the left/right (Moves selector above cards)
    F      - Throw selected card
    P      - Display spheres on grid points (used for visualizing scale)

Camera is free for P4, but will be y-locked for final project.

Thrown cards will stick into the floor and the ceiling - other surfaces coming soon.
